' Description:  Multy Style Command Button. Made from scratch,
'               API drawn.
'               I started this project almost 5 years ago, I've
'               learned a lot since then, I think this version
'               Is the first one that can be used In real world,
'               I've keep this control for my own use for a
'               long Time, But I've used It for personal
'               projects, The only one public release was here:
'               http://www.planetsourcecode.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=51271&lngWId=1
'               I Used It here cuz there was not too much to
'               show then. Afther some months I feel like I
'               could make the final Version, So Here I am.
'               I hope you like It And If you find It useful
'               please vote, leave comments and suggestions,
'               Everything Is wellcome.
'               Best Regards.
